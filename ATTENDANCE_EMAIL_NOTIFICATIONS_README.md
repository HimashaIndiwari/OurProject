# Attendance Email Notifications Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds automatic email notifications for customers when coaches mark attendance in the coaching dashboard. The system sends professional, branded emails to inform customers about their attendance status for each session.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Professional Email Templates
- **Recipient**: Customer's email address
- **Subject**: `✅ Attendance Marked - {Session Title}` or `❌ Attendance Marked - {Session Title}`
- **Content**: 
  - Professional HTML formatting with CricketExpert branding
  - Session details (title, date, time, coach name, description)
  - Clear attendance status (Present/Absent) with appropriate colors and emojis
  - Motivational messages for present attendance
  - Guidance for absent attendance
  - Next steps and action items
  - Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### 2. Email Content Features
- **Present Attendance**: 
  - Green color scheme with ✅ emoji
  - Congratulatory message
  - Encouragement to continue attending
  - Progress tracking information

- **Absent Attendance**:
  - Red color scheme with ❌ emoji
  - Clear notification of absence
  - Instructions to contact coach if incorrect
  - Information about make-up options

## Integration Points

The email notifications are automatically triggered when attendance is marked in the following scenarios:

### 1. Main Attendance Controller (`attendanceController.js`)
- **File**: `controllers/attendanceController.js`
- **Function**: `markAttendance()`
- **Route**: `POST /api/attendance/mark`
- **Trigger**: When attendance is marked for session participants

### 2. Coach Dashboard Attendance (`coachController.js`)
- **File**: `controllers/coachController.js`
- **Function**: `markSessionAttendance()`
- **Route**: `PUT /api/coaches/:id/sessions/:sessionId/attendance`
- **Trigger**: When coaches mark attendance through the dashboard

## Email Service Functions

### New Function Added to `utils/wemailService.js`:

**`sendAttendanceNotificationEmail(customer, session, attendanceStatus, coachName)`**
- Sends professional attendance notification email to customer
- Returns boolean indicating success/failure
- Includes comprehensive session and attendance details
- Handles both present and absent attendance scenarios

### Parameters:
- `customer`: User object with customer details (firstName, lastName, email)
- `session`: Session object with session details (title, scheduledDate, startTime, endTime, description)
- `attendanceStatus`: String - either 'present' or 'absent'
- `coachName`: String - coach's full name for personalization

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables
The following environment variables must be configured:

```env
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
```

### Email Service Setup
- Uses Gmail SMTP (smtp.gmail.com:465)
- Requires Gmail App Password for authentication
- Supports HTML email formatting
- Professional email templates with responsive design

## Error Handling

- **Graceful Degradation**: If email sending fails, attendance marking continues normally
- **Logging**: All email operations are logged with success/failure status
- **Error Isolation**: Email failures don't affect attendance marking functionality
- **Customer Email Validation**: Checks for valid customer email before sending
- **Promise.allSettled**: Uses Promise.allSettled to handle multiple email sends without failing the entire operation

## Testing

A test script is provided (`test-attendance-email.js`) to verify email functionality:

```bash
node test-attendance-email.js
```

### Test Features:
- Tests both present and absent attendance scenarios
- Uses configurable test email address
- Validates email credentials before testing
- Provides detailed success/failure reporting

## Implementation Details

### Email Templates
- **Responsive HTML Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Professional Styling**: Consistent with CricketExpert branding
- **Color-coded Status**: Green for present, red for absent
- **Clear Information Hierarchy**: Session details, status, and next steps
- **Actionable Content**: Specific guidance based on attendance status

### Performance Considerations
- **Parallel Email Sending**: Uses Promise.allSettled for efficient batch email sending
- **Non-blocking**: Email sending doesn't block attendance marking response
- **Error Resilience**: Individual email failures don't affect other emails
- **Memory Efficient**: Processes emails in batches to avoid memory issues

## Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Attendance Marking with Email
```javascript
// When marking attendance, emails are automatically sent
const attendanceData = [
  { participantId: 'user123', attended: true },
  { participantId: 'user456', attended: false }
];

// POST /api/attendance/mark
// Emails are automatically sent to both customers
```

### 2. Coach Dashboard Attendance
```javascript
// PUT /api/coaches/:coachId/sessions/:sessionId/attendance
// Emails are automatically sent when coach marks attendance
```

## Benefits

1. **Customer Engagement**: Customers are immediately informed about their attendance
2. **Transparency**: Clear communication about session attendance status
3. **Professional Image**: Branded, professional email communications
4. **Reduced Support Queries**: Customers can see their attendance status without contacting support
5. **Motivation**: Positive reinforcement for consistent attendance
6. **Accountability**: Clear records and notifications for attendance tracking

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- Email preferences (opt-in/opt-out for notifications)
- Attendance summary emails (weekly/monthly reports)
- Performance feedback emails
- Session reminder emails
- Make-up session scheduling through email links

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Emails not sending**: Check EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS environment variables
2. **Gmail authentication**: Ensure Gmail App Password is used, not regular password
3. **Customer emails missing**: Verify customer has valid email address in database
4. **Email delivery delays**: Check Gmail sending limits and SMTP configuration

### Debug Steps:
1. Check server logs for email sending status
2. Verify email credentials in environment variables
3. Test email functionality using the provided test script
4. Check customer email addresses in the database
5. Verify SMTP configuration and Gmail settings
